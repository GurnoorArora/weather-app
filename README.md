Weather Data Fetching Server using Express
This project is a simple Node.js server built with the Express framework. The server fetches current weather data for a specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API and returns it as a JSON response. This server can be used as a backend service in a larger application or as a standalone service for retrieving weather information.
